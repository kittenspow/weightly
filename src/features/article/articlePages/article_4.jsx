        {/* Section: Master Your Nutrition */}
        <h2 className="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4 mt-8">
          1. Master Your Nutrition: Eating for Weight Loss
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Your plate plays the most significant role in weight management. Focus on quality over quantity, and make informed food choices.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2 pl-4">
          <li>
            <strong className="font-semibold text-blue-600">Create a Moderate Calorie Deficit:</strong> To lose weight, you must consume fewer calories than your body burns. Aim for a deficit of 500-750 calories per day to achieve a healthy and sustainable weight loss of 1-1.5 pounds per week. Use online calculators to estimate your daily calorie needs, but remember these are just estimates.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="font-semibold text-blue-600">Prioritize Protein:</strong> Protein is incredibly satiating, helping you feel fuller for longer and reducing overall calorie intake. It also helps preserve lean muscle mass during weight loss. Include lean protein sources like chicken breast, fish, eggs, Greek yogurt, lentils, and tofu in every meal.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="font-semibold text-blue-600">Load Up on Fiber:</strong> Fiber-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes add bulk to your diet without adding many calories. They promote satiety, aid digestion, and help stabilize blood sugar levels.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="font-semibold text-blue-600">Stay Hydrated:</strong> Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Water can help you feel full, boost your metabolism slightly, and is essential for various bodily functions. Sometimes, thirst can be mistaken for hunger, so try drinking a glass of water before reaching for a snack.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="font-semibold text-blue-600">Limit Processed Foods and Sugary Drinks:</strong> These items are often high in calories, unhealthy fats, added sugars, and sodium, contributing to weight gain and offering little nutritional value. Opt for whole, unprocessed alternatives whenever possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="font-semibold text-blue-600">Practice Mindful Eating:</strong> Pay attention to your hunger and fullness cues. Eat slowly, savor your food, and avoid distractions like TV or smartphones. This can help you recognize when you're truly satisfied and prevent overeating.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="font-semibold text-blue-600">Plan Your Meals:</strong> Preparing your meals in advance can help you make healthier choices and avoid impulsive, unhealthy eating. Portion control is also easier when you prepare your own food.
          </li>
        </ul>

        {/* Section: Optimize Your Movement */}
        <h2 className="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4 mt-8">
          2. Optimize Your Movement: Exercise for Fat Burning and Muscle Building
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Physical activity is crucial for burning calories, boosting metabolism, and improving overall body composition.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2 pl-4">
          <li>
            <strong className="font-semibold text-blue-600">Incorporate Strength Training:</strong> Building muscle is key for long-term weight management. Muscle tissue burns more calories at rest than fat tissue, meaning a more muscular body has a higher resting metabolic rate. Aim for 2-3 full-body strength training sessions per week.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="font-semibold text-blue-600">Engage in Regular Cardio:</strong> Cardiovascular exercise, such as brisk walking, jogging, cycling, or swimming, helps burn calories and improves heart health. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity cardio per week.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="font-semibold text-blue-600">Increase Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT):</strong> This refers to the calories you burn through daily activities outside of structured exercise. Take the stairs instead of the elevator, walk during phone calls, park further away, or stand more often. Every bit of movement adds up.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="font-semibold text-blue-600">Find Activities You Enjoy:</strong> Consistency is paramount. Choose physical activities that you genuinely enjoy, making it easier to stick to your routine in the long run.
          </li>
        </ul>

          3. Cultivate Healthy Lifestyle Habits: The Unsung Heroes of Weight Loss
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Beyond diet and exercise, several lifestyle factors profoundly impact your weight and overall health.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2 pl-4">
          <li>
            <strong className="font-semibold text-blue-600">Prioritize Quality Sleep:</strong> Lack of sleep disrupts hunger-regulating hormones (ghrelin, which increases appetite, and leptin, which signals fullness). Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night to support your weight loss efforts and overall well-being.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="font-semibold text-blue-600">Manage Stress Effectively:</strong> Chronic stress leads to elevated cortisol levels, a hormone that can promote fat storage, particularly in the abdominal area. Find healthy ways to manage stress, such as meditation, yoga, spending time in nature, or hobbies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="font-semibold text-blue-600">Be Patient and Consistent:</strong> Weight loss is not a linear process. There will be plateaus and fluctuations. Focus on consistency in your habits rather than immediate results. Sustainable weight loss takes time and dedication.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="font-semibold text-blue-600">Track Your Progress (Sensibly):</strong> Monitoring your food intake, exercise, and weight can provide valuable insights and keep you accountable. However, avoid obsessing over daily weigh-ins, as normal fluctuations can be discouraging. Focus on weekly averages or how your clothes fit.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="font-semibold text-blue-600">Seek Support:</strong> Whether it's from friends, family, a support group, or a healthcare professional, having a support system can provide motivation and accountability.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="font-semibold text-blue-600">Limit Alcohol Intake:</strong> Alcoholic beverages are often calorie-dense and can lower inhibitions, leading to poor food choices. Consume alcohol in moderation, if at all.
          </li>
        </ul>

        {/* Conclusion */}
        <h2 className="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4 mt-8">
          The Takeaway
        </h2>
